# Stock Fetcher API ðŸ“ˆðŸ“ŠðŸ“‰

The **Stock Fetcher API** is a simple and efficient API for accessing historical stock data. It currently supports top 100 stocks from **NYSE** and **NASDAQ** markets, with more datasets to be added in the future.

This project started as a requirement for accessing stock datasets for coursework in my MSc program in **Management Information Systems**, focusing on **AI and Computational Management Information Systems**. The goal is to provide easy and efficient access to curated stock datasets, and eventually build a Python library inspired by [Yahoo Historical](https://github.com/AndrewRPorter/yahoo-historical) library.

    - Top 100 NASDAQ daily stock prices.
2. **Python Library**:
    - A Python library to provide seamless access to stock data from this API.
    - Inspired by [Yahoo Historical](https://github.com/AndrewRPorter/yahoo-historical).
3. **Additional Datasets**:
    - Support for more markets and datasets.
